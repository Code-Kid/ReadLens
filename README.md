# **Handwritten Character Recognition from Live Camera Feed**

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based system capable of recognizing handwritten characters in real time using a live camera feed. The system will identify and interpret characters from various media, such as paper, signboards, or handwritten notes, ensuring accurate recognition across diverse handwriting styles and real-world conditions.
